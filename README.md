<h2>Volunteer</h2>
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been actively involved in volunteer work, contributing to the tech community and helping others develop their skills and knowledge in cybersecurity and technology.<br>

<h3>OWASP Volunteer</h3>
I had the opportunity to volunteer with OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), where I played a crucial role in the logistics and coordination of a large-scale cybersecurity conference. I was responsible for handling pre-conference preparations, including participant registration and coordinating with sponsors and exhibitors. During the event, I provided technical support for audiovisual systems, ensuring smooth presentations and live sessions for over 1,500 attendees. My efforts were well-received, and I gained valuable experience in managing the technical and operational aspects of large-scale tech events.<br>

<h3>Google Developer Students Club</h3>
As a core team member of the Google Developer Students Club, I organized and led over five workshops and hackathons focused on various technologies, including web development, AI, and cybersecurity. These events attracted a significant number of participants, resulting in a 30% increase in engagement. I also mentored students on coding projects and open-source contributions, helping them enhance their skills and build confidence in their technical abilities. This experience taught me the importance of knowledge sharing and fostering a collaborative environment, which I continue to practice in my professional life.<br>

<h3>Kruptos Security Club</h3>
I served as the Community Manager for the Kruptos Security Club, where I organized and facilitated multiple cybersecurity hackathons and workshops aimed at educating students about the latest trends in cybersecurity. I successfully led initiatives that boosted member participation by 40%, creating a vibrant community of over 100 students who regularly engaged in hands-on learning activities. The workshops I organized covered topics such as ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network security, helping participants gain practical experience in real-world cybersecurity challenges. My leadership in the club not only promoted cybersecurity awareness but also fostered a community that prioritized continuous learning and professional development.<be>
